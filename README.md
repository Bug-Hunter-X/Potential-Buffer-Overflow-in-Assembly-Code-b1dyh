This repository contains an example of a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in assembly code.  The code snippet `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]` is susceptible to a buffer overflow if the value of `ecx` is not carefully validated before use.  The solution demonstrates safe practices to prevent this vulnerability. This is a common error in assembly language programming, so understanding how to prevent it is crucial for secure code development. The `bug.asm` file shows the vulnerable code, and `bugSolution.asm` demonstrates a corrected version that incorporates bounds checking and other safeguards against buffer overflows.
